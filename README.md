# Dev-Time-Django-Backend

This is an API built with Django that allows developers to keep track of their time.

To set the project up, you will need Python 3 and pip.
Optionally (and usually the best option), you can create a virtual environment for isolating your python installation
(see here: https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html).

You can install all the Python packages with the command "pip install -r requirements.txt"

To run the project, run the command "python manage.py" runserver.
